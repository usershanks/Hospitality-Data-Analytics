# Hospitality-Data-Analytics

## Project Overview
AtliQ Grands, with a portfolio of multiple five-star hotels in India, has a 20-year legacy in the hospitality industry. Recently, they have faced a decline in market share and revenue within the luxury/business hotel segment due to competitive strategies from rivals and suboptimal management decisions. To counteract this, the Managing Director of AtliQ Grands is looking to adopt "Business and Data Intelligence" as a strategic measure to reclaim their position in the market. Nevertheless, they lack an internal data analytics team to furnish the necessary insights.
